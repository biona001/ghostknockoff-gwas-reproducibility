# GhostKnockoff GWAS reproducibility

This repo contains source codes used in the paper **Lasso-based Ghostknockoffs: Variable Selection Using Summary Statistics with FDR Control** by Chen et al. 

Note that these source codes are *purely for review and reproducibility purposes*. Users interested in running the overall pipeline should proceed to the main [GhostKnockoffGWAS page](https://github.com/biona001/GhostKnockoffGWAS).
