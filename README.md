# GhostKnockoff GWAS reproducibility

![fig1](Results/Rect_Manhtn.GhostKnockoffLasso_group_Meta-analysis.jpg)

In a series of three papers, we show how the GhostKnockoff framework enables a knockoff-based analysis of GWAS summary statistics data with enhanced power compared to standard GWAS pipelines (e.g. LMM + SuSiE). The main methodology is described in the following papers

1. **Lasso-based Ghostknockoffs: Variable Selection Using Summary Statistics with FDR Control** by Chen et al, with source code available under the *chen_et_al* folder.
2. **Second-order group knockoffs with applications to GWAS** by Chu et al, with source code available in a [separate repo](https://github.com/biona001/group-knockoff-reproducibility).
3. **In silico identification of putative causal genetic variants** by He et al, with source code available under the *he_et_al* folder.

Note that these source codes are *purely for review and reproducibility purposes*. Users interested in running the overall pipeline should proceed to the main [GhostKnockoffGWAS page](https://github.com/biona001/GhostKnockoffGWAS).
